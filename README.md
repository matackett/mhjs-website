# Mental Health and the Justice System team website

## Getting started

Follow the Terminal instructions to get started: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#quick-start

You'll type the command in the **Terminal** (not console) in RStudio. Use an informative name, such as mhjs-site, instead of "mysite". 

This will generate a website with a few pages. Read the [Workflow](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#workflow) section to get an overview of the files that make up a Quarto website. You should see them in the *Files* pane in RStudio. 

## Pages on the site

For now, let's have the following pages on the site. Each page will be a separate .qmd file. 

- **Home**: This will have a brief overview of the overall project. You can use the project description from the Data+ website as a starting point. 
- **Projects**: This will have a brief description of each project the team has done. 
- **People**: This will have people listed under the following headings
  - Principal Investigators: Nicole Schramm-Sapyta and Maria Tackett
  - Project Manager: Garrett Baker
  - Undergraduate Researchers: Irene Biju, Foxx Hart, Will Lieber
  - Lab Alumni: Will provide a list later
  - Stakeholders: Can list stakeholders from the presentation slides.

(We'll have a picture for the PI's, PM, and current undergraduate researchers, so you can start asking people for those.)
- **Publications**: Will provide list later

## Publishing the site

We will publish the site using GitHub pages. You can publish the page using the publish command in the **Terminal**. [Click here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publishing) for the instructions.
